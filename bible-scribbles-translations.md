[Bible Scribbles](http://biblescribbles.com/) is an Android app for cross-translation, offline Bible notes. See [http://biblescribbles.com/](http://biblescribbles.com/) for more info. The goal of this page is to explain the situation with various translations in Bible Scribbles.

The **bad news**: most mainstream Bible translations aren't available in Bible Scribbles. 

This is due to copyright law and restrictions that most publishers impose on Christians everywhere. Even if you bought a physical copy of a Bible translation, or even a digital copy in a different Bible app, Bible publishers stop you from reading that Bible in other ways. They encrypt the Bible translation- think of it like a digital lock, and they won't give the key to Bible Scribbles.

Some examples of translations where the publisher restricts how and where you can read your Bible (which means you can't get them in Bible Scribbles):
* NIV
* ESV
* NRSV

The **good news**: There are some Bible translators that have dedicated their hard work simply to the kingdom of God, and freely given their translation to the body of Christ without any restrictions. These Bibles are in the public domain. Some Bibles included in that list:
* KJV
* WEB - a good translation if you need a quick pick for something more modern
* ASV
* DARBY
* YLT

In the future, I would like to hook up Bible Scribbles to online Bibles (technically speaking, a Bible "REST API"). That would allow reading translations like the ESV. My main priority in building Bible Scribbles was to provide a completely offline Bible note-taking app though. There's a moderate amount of work needed to support online Bibles, so it won't come soon. One of these days, perhaps.

If you think there's some Bible translation that could be available on Bible Scribbles, feel free to email me at support@biblescribbles.com. Note that you can always download the translation yourself and then import it, if it's in the correct format. So give that a try and let me know how it goes in your email.

Thanks, and may the Lord bless you and keep you!
